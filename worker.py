    Background worker placeholder.

    Some long-running background tasks that should operate independently of the Flask request/response cycle.
    Examples of future use cases include:
        - Monitoring external APIs or live chat feeds (e.g., livestream comments).
        - Periodically refreshing cached data.
        - Running scheduled or asynchronous processing tasks.

    The worker is executed in a separate daemon thread from app.py when enabled.
